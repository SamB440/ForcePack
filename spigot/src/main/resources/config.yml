# Should we use the 1.17+ force resource pack screen, or the old one?

# This configures the web server for force pack.
# See https://fortitude.islandearth.net/forcepack/configuration#self-hosting
# Note that you can leave the IP as localhost unless it is not working, as in most cases the plugin can automatically resolve it.
# Having this enabled allows the use of the "forcepack://" protocol in resource pack URL
# Enabling this DOES NOT mean you are forced to use a localhost resource pack.
# You need to make sure the port is open. Usually you can just add it via pterodactyl panel.
