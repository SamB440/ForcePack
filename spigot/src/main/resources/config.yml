# Should ForcePack load on the first tick after the server has started?

# Should we use the 1.17+ force resource pack screen, or the old one?
# You can still define a custom message that will show even if this is false for 1.17+ clients
# Note that with this true, the custom disconnect message will not work because the client forcefully kicks itself

# This configures the web server for force pack.
# See ItemsAdder tutorial, which is essentially the same: https://itemsadder.devs.beer/plugin-usage/resourcepack-hosting/resourcepack-self-hosting
# Note that you can leave the IP as localhost unless it is not working, as in most cases the plugin can automatically resolve it.
# Having this enabled allows:
#  - The use of the "forcepack://" protocol in resource pack URL
#  - Better user experience when fake accept hacks detection is enabled
# Enabling this DOES NOT mean you are forced to use a localhost resource pack.
# You need to make sure the port is open. Usually you can just add it via pterodactyl panel.

      # For example, placing your resource pack as "plugins/ForcePack/pack.zip", the url will just be "forcepack://pack.zip".
