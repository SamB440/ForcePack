## About The Project

ForcePack facilitates forcing users to accept your resource pack, with utilities such as live reloading, SHA-1 generation, and per-server support via velocity.

You can find the Spigot resource at: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/forcepack.45439/

## Features
- Pack unloading for Velocity sub-servers without a resource pack
- Local webserver resource pack hosting
- Prevents escaping out bypass for clients <= 1.12 (requires ViaVersion for Spigot)
- Run commands on pack statuses
- RGB via MiniMessage support
- Prevent failed downloads from bypassing the resource pack
- Geyser support to ignore bedrock players
- Per-client version maximum size verification
- SHA-1 and URL pack verification
- SHA-1 Auto-generation
- Per-server support on Velocity
- Live reloading with resource pack updating
- Easy to use custom force resource pack message for 1.17+ clients
